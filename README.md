# Console-Sudoku-Board-Generator

Written in C to be run in a console. Program generates a full sudoku board. Then uses a back tracking algorithm to generate a difficult (still solvable with one unique solution) sudoku board. The program then performs a depth first traversal to solve the board (which will be the same as the first full board generated. This can be used to verify a human solution to the game). Program outputs all three boards to the console as there are generated.

Code can be modified to generate boards of varying difficultly. This code could also be build upon to create a more complete sudoku game with a UI.
